This is a list of some posts and talks I have read and watch during the last days. I write it to keep track of interesting content for myself, but you might also find it useful.

## Posts

- [Jon Sneyers](https://twitter.com/jonsneyers) from Cloudinary posted [Detecting the psychovisual impact of compression related artifacts using SSIMULACRA](http://cloudinary.com/blog/detecting_the_psychovisual_impact_of_compression_related_artifacts_using_ssimulacra). It talks about SSIM (which [I have covered in the past](/ssim-jpeg-io)), used to compress images based as much as possible without affecting the visual appearance (no visible artifacts). Jon describes [Cloudinary's SSIMULACRA](https://github.com/cloudinary/ssimulacra) and benchmarks it agains the top perceptual metrics.

- [Tech companies: these are the perks (and benefits) I want](https://hackernoon.com/tech-companies-these-are-the-perks-and-benefits-i-want-5e9788c30958). I agree with Tara's points about what I find important in my job and hope more companies embrace them.

## Tools

- [Cloudinary released](http://cloudinary.com/blog/introducing_website_speed_test_an_image_analysis_tool_integrated_with_webpagetest) their [Website Speed Test Image Analysis Tool](https://webspeedtest.cloudinary.com), which is also integrated with WebPagetest.

## Talks

- [Nic Jansma](https://twitter.com/nicj) and [Shubhie Panicker](https://twitter.com/shubhie) gave a talk at Fluent Conf named "Reliably Measuring Responsiveness in the Wild". [The slides for the talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15DsvKVrt9vIL5s-wH4VhCGEhS-FkjD5pP3dH1-hzPi8/edit) are already available. They are full with great insights and are a must if you are into web performance. They show how to on measure responsiveness using old and new Browser APIs like [PerformanceObserver](/paint-timing-api), and show examples from real sites and how these metrics affect conversion rates.

## Conferences

- [Alex Fern√°ndez](https://twitter.com/pinchito) has published [How Much Did JSDayES 2017 Cost?](http://pinchito.es/2017/jsdayes-2017-cost.html). This is a conference [I attended](/jsdayes-madrid-2017) and it's eye-opening to see how much effort is put behind the scenes.

- I'm from Alicante, Spain, and I was very happy to find out about [React Alicante 2017](http://reactalicante.es). There are not many tech conferences in the area, and I hope it is a success. I'm glad I'll attend!
