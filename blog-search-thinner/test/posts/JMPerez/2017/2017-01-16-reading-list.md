I have decided to collect some of the best posts and articles I have read during last days. It is inspired by [Bruce Lawson](http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/)’s reading lists and web development newsletters. I write it to keep track of interesting content for myself, but you might also find it useful.

## Posts

* [**Modernizing our Progressive Enhancement Delivery**](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/modernizing-delivery.html). Another excellent post by Filament Group. This time they talk about integrating HTTP/2 and ServiceWorker on their site, providing good performance and offline capabilities.
* [**Google AMP Cache, AMP Lite, and the need for speed**](https://developers.googleblog.com/2017/01/google-amp-cache-amp-lite-and-need-for.html). A post on how Google processes images in AMP articles to improve performance based on compression, responsive images and WebP. By the way, if you are into AMP, don’t miss [the first AMP Conf](https://www.ampproject.org/amp-conf-2017), which will be live-streamed.
* [**Saving you bandwidth through machine learning**](https://blog.google/products/google-plus/saving-you-bandwidth-through-machine-learning/). Another post by Google, this time on upscaling small images while keeping crisp details and reducing the blurriness of traditional methods. The [algorithm is called RAISR](https://research.googleblog.com/2016/11/enhance-raisr-sharp-images-with-machine.html) and can be run on mobile devices in real time.
* [**Start with a line, let the planet complete the picture**](https://developers.googleblog.com/2016/12/landlines.html). A fun project in which you draw lines and get images from Google Maps to create an infinite line of rivers, roads or coastlines. It made me discover the [Vantage-point tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vantage-point_tree) structure.
* [**Preparing for a Front-End Web Development Interview in 2017**](http://davidshariff.com/blog/preparing-for-a-front-end-web-development-interview-in-2017/). A post by David Shariff, from Amazon, on the topics you should when interviewing for a front-end dev position.
* [**How I converted my React app to VanillaJS (and whether or not it was a terrible idea)**](https://hackernoon.com/how-i-converted-my-react-app-to-vanillajs-and-whether-or-not-it-was-a-terrible-idea-4b14b1b2faff). A long and insightful post on writing a website mimicking React’s approach using VanillaJS. If you like it, the same author wrote another good post called [10 things I learned making the fastest site in the world](https://hackernoon.com/10-things-i-learned-making-the-fastest-site-in-the-world-18a0e1cdf4a7) a few days ago.

## Presentations

* [**Advanced Webpack**](http://presentations.survivejs.com/advanced-webpack/). A deck by [Juho Vepsäläinen](https://twitter.com/bebraw) explaining Webpack 2 configuration, code-splitting, plugins, loaders, optimising bundles and more.
* [**Preact & Inferno**](https://speakerdeck.com/btholt/preact-and-inferno). A short deck by [Brian Holt](https://twitter.com/holtbt) from Netflix comparing react, preact and inferno. I can’t find a recording, but I think it is a good overview of three libraries that are solving the same problem.

## Videos

* [**What Comes Next Is The Future**](https://vimeo.com/177267839). A very interesting documentary about the Web that [started as a Kickstarter project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bearded/what-comes-next-is-the-future) and is now available to everyone for free. A must-watch for every web developer to understand the history of web development.
