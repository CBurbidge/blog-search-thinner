This week I change jobs, from [Signum Software](http://signumsoftware.com/en) to [Tuenti](http://www.tuenti.com).

Working at Signum Software I have met a group of very professional people and I learnt a lot from them. It is a pleasure to work at a company that takes care of their own products, always trying to improve them. And for a developer it's even better when that product is a complete framework that optimizes and makes your work easier.

If you are willing to carry out a .Net project, you'd better have a look at Signum Framework. Version 2 will be soon released, and lots of new features will be presented. You can follow them on [twitter @signumframework](http://twitter.com/signumframework) to get last news, and extended documentation is available on [signumframework.com](http://www.signumframework.com).

I wish Signum the best of luck, and I hope more developers realize how Signum Framework can improve their projects development, manageability and maintainability.
