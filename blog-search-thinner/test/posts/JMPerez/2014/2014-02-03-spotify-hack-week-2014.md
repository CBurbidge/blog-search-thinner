We have just finished the second edition of the **Spotify Hack Week**. Like [the previous one](/spotify-hack-week-2013/), the whole company has been hacking for a whole week lots of different projects. We have played with Raspberry Pi, 3D printers, and even stationary bicycles.

I worked on a project involving the [Spotify website](http://www.spotify.com) and the [web player](http://play.spotify.com). It was a good chance to get familiar with some code I hadn't worked with yet.

It is a pleasure to be able to work on something different for a week. There were great projects and I am very excited after having seen what my colleagues built.
