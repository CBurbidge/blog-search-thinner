These days I have been playing with the Web Audio API in [a small pet project](
/karaoke/). It consists on a web page where you can drag and drop an audio file and play it removing the vocals. Perfect for a basic karaoke!
And it even works on mobile!

It is exciting to see how powerful it can be, making it super easy to manipulate sound client-side.
