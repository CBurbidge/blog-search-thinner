Last weekend Spotify hosted the [Music Hack Day Stockholm 2013](http://stockholm.musichackday.org/2013/) at their office in Stockholm. In the end, [65 projects](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/music-hack-day-stockholm-13/hacks) were built by 162 participants, using APIs from a variety of music services such as Echonest, Musixmatch, Soundcloud, Radio and Spotify among others.

Overall it was a great experience. This was my first hacking event where people from outside my company participated. My project was Extendify, a Chrome Extension that injects Spotify Play Buttons in pages where it detects info related to a track, album or artist. You can [check it out on Github](https://github.com/JMPerez/extendify).

You can find nice pictures of the event on [this set of Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jcb1973/) and [Eventifier](http://eventifier.co/event/musichackday13).
