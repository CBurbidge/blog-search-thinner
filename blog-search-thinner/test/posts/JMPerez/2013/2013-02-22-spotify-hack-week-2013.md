![Spotify Hack Week](/assets/images/posts/spotify-hackweek-logo.png)This week almost the whole Spotify company have been working on hack projects. Having 5 days to implement your project is a nice thing, especially after having participated in many 24h ones, and encourage you to come up with more complex projects that otherwise wouldn't be possible to implement.

On the [Spotify Labs blog](http://labs.spotify.com/) there is [a post on how the hack week was organized](http://labs.spotify.com/2013/02/15/organizing-a-hack-week/), and you have [a video by Kitchen TV](http://kitchen-tv.com/2013/projects/spotify-hack-week/).

The project is a website showing real-time information about tracks being played, skipped and shared by country through Spotify. We even develop a trending-tracks algorithm.
The thing I enjoyed the most was developing using the same language both client-side and server-side. Not switching once and again really decreases your task-switching headaches.

In my case this was the first time I played around with node.js and socket.io. I also wanted to have a look at CoffeeScript, Less and Angular.js, but in the end I didn't. In short, all those libraries and frameworks I always want to give a try but I never find a project in which to apply it.

There have been a bunch of really cool projects and I hope some of these hack projects can make it into a real product.
