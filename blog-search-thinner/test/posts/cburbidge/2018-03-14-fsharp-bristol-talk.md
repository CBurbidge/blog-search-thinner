I debuted my talk 'Hunting typosquatters with F#' at the F# Bristol meetup tonight. I was excited to share my work with the group and very pleased with the execution and reaction. Hopefully i've helped to spread the good news about the F# language and it's wonderful features.

I'd like to thank the group organisers for the opportunity and the beer and pizza.
