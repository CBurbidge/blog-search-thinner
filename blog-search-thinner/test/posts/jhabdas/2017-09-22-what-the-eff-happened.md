Spotted this in the [Frontend Focus](https://frontendfoc.us). The EFF has chosen to withdraw from the W3C due to concerns in the direction the W3C moves as it relates to the openness of the World Wide Web. Perhaps not as alarming as KJU calling Trump a ‘dotard’ and [threatening him](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/22/a-rogue-and-a-gangster-kim-jong-uns-statement-on-trump-in-full) with fire — it's certainly not very settling either.
