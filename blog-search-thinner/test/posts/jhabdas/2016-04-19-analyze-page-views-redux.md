Recently, on [TADevelops](http://technologyadvice.github.io/), I wrote about how to capture [App Analytics with Redux](http://technologyadvice.github.io/app-analytics-redux/). If you're looking to measure page view events in your Redux app and haven't seen it yet, please give it a scan. Even if you're not using the de facto community routers the approach can be modified to emit analytics events from your Redux app to a number of different providers with relative ease using a single existing middleware integration for Redux.
