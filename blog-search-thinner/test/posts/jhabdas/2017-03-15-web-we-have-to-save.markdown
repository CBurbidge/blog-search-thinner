In March of 2017 Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Web posted [a short article on The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/11/tim-berners-lee-web-inventor-save-internet) covering three things we need to do to save the Web.

To paraphrase, they are:

- Increase individual control over sharing of personal data
- Improve diversity in Social media and Search channels
- Create more transparency behind political advertising

The third of which is, in my opinion, really just an extension of the second, so let's briefly cover the first two and **what you can do as individuals to address Tim's concerns right now**. When you're finished, you'll have a deeper understanding of how to protect your privacy online.

> Increase individual control over sharing of personal data

There have been steps taken recently by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to help individuals gain control over their personal data in the form of the "Cookie Law", which, unfortunately, has lead to a bevy of websites throwing up banners in traditional ad spaces explaining they use cookies. Only everyone knows that already. **Pretty annoying an ineffectual if you ask me.** So ineffectual, in fact, the very organization responsible for producing legislation behind the Cookie Law [will stop asking users for permission](https://silktide.com/the-stupid-cookie-law-is-dead-at-last/) to set cookies on their very own website. What a gas.

Anyway, to gain control over personal data such a heavy-handed approach should not be used. Instead, raising awareness and helping individuals **understand how to go [Beyond Incognito](https://hackcabin.com/post/beyond-incognito/)**, and to read the terms of websites they visit, is a much better approach to putting individuals in control of their information if you ask me. Onwards.

> Improve diversity in Social media and Search channels

In my opinion, social media is **the number one threat to privacy online.** I don't mind my information being stored in miniature silos as I surf, just so long as those silos do not connect me in any way to the _Social Graph_. But with Facebook they are indeed connected, and **they are connected in [some very heinous ways](https://medium.com/@jhabdas/what-i-learned-in-4-years-without-facebook-981fb68a64e2)**. We have only capitalism to thank for that mess. And it'll take years before competitors such as Snap, Inc. are able to counter it (but I believe eventually they will).

As for search, I have only one suggestion. We need to break up Google like we [broke up Ma Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System) during the Regan Administration. It's an unfortunate shame to see just how much **power and dominance Google exerts** over the free flow of information on the Web. And in their monopoly over search the only way to fix it may be through [Competition (Antitrust) law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law). In the meanwhile, if you want to get a better glimpse at the gems which lie beyond page one of the Google <abbr title="Search Engine Results Page">SERP</abbr>, simply change your default search provider to [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) and call it a day. I did so several years ago, and I've personally felt more secure online ever since.
